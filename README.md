In conclusion, DHL Logistics Facility Data Analytics project, utilizing IBM Cognos Analytics, has provided valuable insights into the delivery operations of DHL. Through the use of various analysis charts and graphs, we have gained a deeper understanding of the key trends and patterns in DHL deliveries.

One of the key accomplishments of our project was the creation of multiple analysis charts and graphs. These visual representations allowed us to effectively analyze and communicate complex data in a clear and concise manner. By leveraging the power of IBM Cognos Analytics, we were able to generate insightful visualizations that facilitated data-driven decision-making.

One of the notable visualizations was the Area Chart showing city-wise DHL deliveries. This chart enabled us to identify the distribution of deliveries across different cities, providing a comprehensive overview of the geographic coverage of DHL's operations.

Additionally, we utilized the analyzed data to create a dashboard that included various interactive visualizations. This dashboard featured insightful components such as the "Top N Deliveries by State and City" and "Top 3 State Deliveries." These components allowed for quick identification of the most significant delivery volumes and hotspots, assisting in resource allocation and operational planning.

Furthermore, our analysis resulted in the creation of a summary chart and a bar chart showing deliveries. These visualizations provided a concise summary of key delivery metrics, such as total deliveries and delivery status breakdown, enabling stakeholders to gain a quick and comprehensive understanding of the overall performance.

Overall, our DHL Logistics Facility Data Analytics project utilizing IBM Cognos Analytics has provided actionable insights into the delivery operations of DHL. The creation of analysis charts, interactive dashboards, and visualizations has enhanced decision-making processes, enabling stakeholders to optimize resource allocation, identify key delivery trends, and improve overall operational efficiency.

# Case Study: Analysis of Medical Premium charges for insurers using IBM Watson Studio and ML 

In conclusion, case study on the analysis of medical premium charges for insurers, utilizing IBM Watson Studio, has provided valuable insights into the factors influencing premium rates in the healthcare industry. Through various stages of data refinement, descriptive analytics, exploratory analytics, and the implementation of an SPSS Modeler model, we have gained a comprehensive understanding of the underlying patterns and trends in medical premium charges.

One of the key steps in our analysis was the data refinement process, which involved cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for analysis. By ensuring data quality and consistency, we were able to generate accurate and reliable insights throughout the study.

Descriptive analytics played a vital role in our analysis, allowing us to summarize and understand the characteristics of the dataset. By leveraging the power of IBM Watson Studio, we were able to perform descriptive analytics on the data, uncovering key information such as age distribution, gender disparities, premium rates, and regional variations.

To further explore the relationships between different variables, we utilized box charts in our exploratory analytics. Specifically, we employed box charts to visualize the distribution of premiums across different age groups, split by gender, as well as premiums across different regions. These visualizations enabled us to identify potential patterns, outliers, and disparities that could impact premium charges.
